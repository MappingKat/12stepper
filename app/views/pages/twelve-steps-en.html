<p>THE TWELVE STEPS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol&mdash;that our lives had become&nbsp;<br />unmanageable.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to&nbsp;<br />sanity.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we&nbsp;<br />understood Him.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature&nbsp;<br />of our wrongs.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make&nbsp;<br />amends to them all.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do&nbsp;<br />so would injure them or others.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly&nbsp;<br />admitted it.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with&nbsp;<br />God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us&nbsp;<br />and the power to carry that out.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to&nbsp;<br />carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our&nbsp;<br />affairs.&nbsp;</p>
