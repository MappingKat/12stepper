<h1>The Serenity Prayer (Full Version)</h1><p>God, give me grace to accept with serenity<br />the things that cannot be changed,<br />Courage to change the things<br />which should be changed,<br />and the Wisdom to distinguish<br />the one from the other.</p><p>Living one day at a time,<br />Enjoying one moment at a time,<br />Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,<br />Taking, as Jesus did,<br />This sinful world as it is,<br />Not as I would have it,<br />Trusting that You will make all things right,<br />If I surrender to Your will,<br />So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,<br />And supremely happy with You forever in the next.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>--Reinhold Niebuhr</p>
