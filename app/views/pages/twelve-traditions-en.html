<p>THE TWELVE TRADITIONS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS&nbsp;<br />(SHORT FORM)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon&nbsp;<br />A.A. unity.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority&mdash;a loving God as&nbsp;<br />He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but&nbsp;<br />trusted servants; they do not govern.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3. The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups&nbsp;<br />or A.A. as a whole.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Each group has but one primary purpose&mdash;to carry its message to the&nbsp;<br />alcoholic who still suffers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />6. An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any&nbsp;<br />related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and&nbsp;<br />prestige divert us from our primary purpose.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />7. Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside&nbsp;<br />contributions.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our&nbsp;<br />service centers may employ special workers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />9. A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards&nbsp;<br />or committees directly responsible to those they serve.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A.&nbsp;<br />name ought never be drawn into public controversy.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we&nbsp;<br />need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and&nbsp;<br />films.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us&nbsp;<br />to place principles before personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
