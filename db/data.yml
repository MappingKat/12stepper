      about my practice of the 12 Steps?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We discuss the purpose,
      plan and session format of this Steps by the Big Book group course. Consider
      that each member is expected to not only talk about but to do each of the Steps
      and, if possible, to attend every session with the team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This

      about:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your own definition of each word in this Step, and

      what each part means to you: We <strong>admit</strong> that we are <strong>powerless</strong>
      over our <strong>alcoholism-addiction</strong> and that our lives [and minds]
      have been and are <strong>unmanageable</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How am

      Big Book and <em>12&amp;12</em> suggestions for meditation and prayer, or choose
      a practice that is in line with your own belief system. The goal is to set aside

      say to me about my practice of Step 1?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we each go
      about our daily activities, we think about the people, places, and things that
      are unmanageable, or over which we are powerless. Each day we write: &ldquo;I
      cannot control / have no power over________.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also
      list what we can control and what we do have power over.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We

      by Dr. Silkworth in the Doctor&rsquo;s Opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      1.) &nbsp; The mental obsession (xxviii: 4)&nbsp; [(L obsession- siege) preoccupation,
      fixed idea]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.) &nbsp; The physical compulsion [physical
      <em>craving </em>or <em>allergy</em> (xxx: 0), compelled to act]&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;

      (59: 2)]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I affected by Dr. Silkworth&rsquo;s definition
      of alcoholism as a medical problem? (xxx: 0) [Disease: (L- To lack ease.) Involuntary
      disability. See 64: 3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I drink <em>essentially because </em>[I]<em>
      like the effect produced by alcohol</em>? (xxviii: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I been <em>restless, irritable, and discontented</em>? (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I sought <em>the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few
      drinks</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describe in detail how I succumbed
      <em>to the desire again</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did
      I reach the point where I could not differentiate <em>the true from the false</em>?&nbsp;
      (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did I first experience an abnormal mental obsession
      with alcohol? Describe. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)
      &nbsp; Physical Compulsion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Body:&nbsp; <em>powerless</em>&nbsp;
      (59: 2)]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did I develop the <em>physical&hellip;phenomenon
      of craving </em>[<em>allergy</em>]? (xxvii: 7 -xxviii: 0,1; xxix: 0, 4; xxx:
      1, 5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I describe my pathological physical reaction to alcohol?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what ways has my alcoholic body become as sick as my alcoholic mind? (xxvi:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding of the concept of alcoholism as the
      <em>manifestation of an allergy</em>? (xxviii: 1)&nbsp; [Allergy (Gr allos &ndash;
      strange): An abnormal reaction.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I feel about the idea
      of hospitalization? (xxvi: 4; xxviii: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did I first experience
      a physical compulsion or craving for alcohol? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; Drinking to Excess:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did I <em>pass
      through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution
      not to drink again</em>? (xxix: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did I repeat this
      <em>over and over</em>? (xxix: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my reflections on the
      ideas that alcoholism <em>has never been&hellip;permanently eradicated</em>;
      and that <em>the only relief&hellip;is entire abstinence</em>? (xxx: 5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      did I first experience the loss of control of my drinking? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.)
      &nbsp; Psychic Change</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding of a <em>psychic
      change</em>? (xxix: 1, 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is meant by being <em>required
      to follow a few simple rules</em>? (xxix: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that,
      if I have been abstinent from alcohol a while, Step 1 is about my powerlessness
      over some other behavior or thought-habit that reflects the unmanageability
      of my life and mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that I need to find a way to stop
      that behavior so that my surrender is not blocked by continued acting out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is of significance to me in this chapter?&nbsp; What do I not agree with?</p>\r\n"

      </strong>Read in the Big Book how in 1934 one of AA&#39;s founders, Bill W.,
      learned of the problem, the solution, and the program of action to recover from
      alcoholism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The <strong>Problem</strong>: From Dr. Silkworth,
      Bill learned of the medical problem of alcoholism as both a mental and a physical
      illness. (7:1; xxv-xxxii)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The <strong>Solution</strong>: From
      Dr. Carl Jung, (through Roland H. and Ebby T.) Bill learned of the spiritual
      solution to the problem as a <em>necessary vital spiritual experience</em>.
      (27: 5; see also 9: 6; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The <strong>Program of Action</strong>:
      From the Oxford Group (through Ebby T.), Bill learned of the discipline of practicing
      a step by step program of principles and action that opens one to the necessary
      <em>vital spiritual experiences.</em>&nbsp; (27: 4) [See also He Sold Himself

      review selections from Bill&#39;s Story together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We each
      consider sharing our own writings and personal Step 1 stories with the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather

      2-14: 6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; The <em>Problem</em> (17: 1)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      did Bill mean by, <em>I commenced to forge the weapon&hellip;that one day would
      turn&hellip;like a boomerang and&hellip;cut me to ribbons</em>? (2: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was
      there a time for me when <em>liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity</em>?
      (5: 1) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I think <em>I could control the situation</em>?

      does an <em>appalling lack of perspective&nbsp;</em> relate to sanity, honesty,
      or humility? (5: 5)&nbsp; What do sanity, honesty, and humility mean to me?
      [Optional: <em>12&amp;12</em> pp, 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what
      specific ways did I feel <em>the remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next
      morning</em>? (6: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I ask, <em>Should I kill myself</em>?
      (6: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In what ways did I seek <em>oblivion</em>? (6: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In
      what ways have I felt fear? (6: 2, 7: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my reflections
      on Dr. Silkworth&#39;s proposition that we have been <em>seriously ill, bodily
      and mentally</em>? (7: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I see that <em>I could not take
      so much as one drink</em>? (5: 4) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did such <em>self-knowledge</em>
      (7: 2) of the problem of <em>the insanity of that first drink </em>(8: 2) alone
      keep me sober?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill describes taking Step 1 by admitting,
      <em>Alcohol was my master</em>. (8: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways has alcohol
      been my master? (8: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) &nbsp;
      The <em>Solution</em> (17: 3)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding
      of the <em>simple religious idea</em>? (9: 6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was my reaction
      to&rsquo; religion&rsquo;, &lsquo;the church&rsquo;, and &lsquo;God&rsquo;?
      (10: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I react to the suggestion, <em>Why don&rsquo;t
      you choose your own conception of God?</em> (12: 2; 46: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill
      takes Step 2 when he understands that, <em>nothing more was required...to make
      my beginning</em> than <em>being willing</em> <em>to believe</em>. (12: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note
      that Bill was instructed <em>to sit quietly</em> and <em>to</em> <em>test </em>[his]<em>
      thinking by the new God-consciousness within</em>. (13: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)

      is my understanding of the <em>practical program of action</em>? (9: 6)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      did this derive from the non-alcoholic <em>Oxford Groups of that day</em>? (
      xvi: 0; and see 263: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are <em>the essential requirements</em>,
      as I understand them? (13: 5 - 14: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I understand, <em>It

      the <em>revolutionary and drastic proposals</em>? (14: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note
      that Bill essentially takes Step 3 through Step 12 at this time while still
      in the hospital. [Step 1 (8: 1); Step 2 (12: 4); Steps 3-11 (13: 2-4); Step

      is one who loses <em>all control of his liquor consumption once he begins to
      drink</em>? (21: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I a <em>real alcoholic</em>? (21:

      think we needed to be so much in control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection&nbsp; </strong>(Consider pp. 44: 1,3; 45: 1,2,3; 47:
      1; 52: 1,2,3; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; Am I willing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I believe that other alcoholics have found peace of mind through this process?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is it, precisely and in detail, that I have worshipped? (54: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What,
      exactly, have I experienced? (55: 2-3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I willing to consider
      that I am not at the core of everything &ndash; good or bad &ndash; and hence
      there may be a power greater than any one of us?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was I insane
      or crazy to believe the lies the alcohol told me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)
      &nbsp; My Problem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do these definitions of alcoholism
      mean to me?:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -<em> when you honestly want to</em>,
      <em>you find you cannot quit</em> <em>entirely</em>&nbsp; [Mind]<em> &nbsp;
      &nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - <em>when drinking, you have little
      control over the amount you take.</em> [Body]<em> &nbsp; </em>(44: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      being <em>crazy</em> or <em>insanity</em> is a loss of <em>perspective</em>
      and <em>proportion</em> (5: 5; 37: 1), how is this like denial, dishonesty,
      or lack of humility? [<em>12&amp;12</em> pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what areas of my life do I need sanity now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways am I
      addicted to my painful and insane ways of thinking and reacting?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; My Solution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I react when the authors tell
      me that <em>we must find a spiritual basis in life &ndash; or else</em>? (44:
      3) <strong>&nbsp; </strong>In what ways am I spiritual?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does
      this mean to me:&nbsp; the Big Book&rsquo;s <em>main object</em> <em>is to enable
      you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem</em>?
      (45: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.) &nbsp; My Own Conception
      of a Higher Power</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>What do the
      terms<em> &lsquo;</em>agnostic,&rsquo; &lsquo;we came to believe&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;restore us to sanity&rsquo; mean to me? (See 55: 1-4,&nbsp; 57: 0)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my childhood training about God affect my life and recovery today? (45:
      3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does it mean when the authors of the Big Book say, <em>When,
      therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God</em>?
      <em>This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions</em>&hellip;. <em>What</em>
      [do] <em>they mean to you</em>? (47: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does <em>work</em>
      mean, as in, <em>Is not our age characterized by the ease with which we discard
      old ideas for new,&hellip;throw away the theory or gadget which does not </em><em>work</em><em>
      for something new which does</em>? (52: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What works and does
      not work in my life to give me serenity and peace of mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
      me, how is it that, <em>Our ideas did not </em><em>work</em><em>. But the God
      idea did</em>? (52: 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III
      &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 2 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I practice my new belief that I can get well or more well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I know that help is available, that I am not entirely alone?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I stop relying on my own thinking and begin to ask for help today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I be <em>willing to grow along spiritual lines</em>? (60: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I sought help from my sponsor, gone to meetings, and reached out to other recovering
      alcoholics? What were the results?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I find a sign of
      a higher power in the support I receive from the fellowship?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      then according to the Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we take
      Step 2.&nbsp; Keep in mind that our reasonable best is always more than good

      &nbsp; </strong>(Consider pp. 60: 3-63: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; 1.) &nbsp; The Problem of Self</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.) &nbsp; <em>Each person is like an actor who
      wants to run the whole show</em></strong><em>.</em> (60: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Our
      actor is self-centered &hellip; Are not most of us concerned with our resentments,
      our self-pity, or ourselves?</em> (61: 2-62: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I like
      an actor? (60: 4)&nbsp; What roles, what masks, what characters do I play? Are
      these old worn out defenses? [See 73: 1; Optional <em>12&amp;12</em>, 57: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am
      I <em>almost always in collision with something or some body</em>? (60: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; b.)<em> &nbsp; The show doesn&rsquo;t come off</em></strong>. (61: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      do I think that life does not treat me right? (61: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      do my actions make the other players wish to retaliate and snatch all they can
      get out of the show? (61: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my own life, am I familiar with
      the progression: anger =&gt; indignation =&gt; self-pity? (61: 1)&nbsp; Describe
      in detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways does the following describe me? <em>Is
      he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness
      out of this world if he only manages well?</em> (61: 1) [Is this the essence
      of Step 1?] -What do <em>delusion</em> (30: 2; 61: 1), <em>denial</em> (10:
      1), and <em>manages</em> (61: 1) mean to me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; c.)<em> &nbsp; So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making</em></strong>.
      (62: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t alcohol
      and other people cause all my troubles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do my reactions to
      life events make me suffer?&nbsp; Be specific. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Driven
      by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step
      on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate</em>. (62: 1)&nbsp; Is this so?&nbsp;
      How?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where in the past have I made decisions based on self that
      later placed me in a position to be hurt? (62: 1)&nbsp; Be specific and give
      details. [See what self-instincts can be threatened, and that we react to, in
      the Step 4 <em>Affects My</em> column (65: 2)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;

      has my playing God worked, or not worked, to give me and others serenity?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We
      had to quit playing God. It didn&rsquo;t work</em>. (62: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      did I stop playing God?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.) The Program
      of Action</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I make a decision to turn my life and will
      over to a higher power of my understanding, just for today?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what ways am I taking action on Step 3 when I abstain from alcohol and work
      the remaining Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 Promises:<strong> </strong>&nbsp;
      Is it possible that I could enjoy <em>peace of mind</em>, <em>face life successfully</em>,

      does Step 3 allow me to build on the surrender I have developed in Step 1 and
      Step 2?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I fighting anything in recovery? What do I think would
      happen if I became willing to let recovery prevail in that area of my life?
      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I reaffirm my decision on a daily basis and continue
      to take the action of working the rest of the Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I

      of a written inventory beyond an assets/liabilities checklist. Watch for paralysis
      from fear/perfectionism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We come here with a huge load of stored
      up shame, guilt, and unresolved pain to be let go of. Step 4 helps us lay bare
      the conflicts of the past so that we are no longer at their mercy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step
      4 gives us the means to find out who we are, and what we are not. It is about
      finding our assets as well as our defects of character. We discover that our
      problems began long before we took our first drink. We may have felt isolated
      and afraid, and it was our desire to change the way we felt that led to our
      drinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a disease. We are not responsible for being
      an alcoholic, any more than a diabetic is responsible for being diabetic. But
      now that we know we are an alcoholic, we are responsible for our recovery. There
      are no longer excuses, because we realize we must live the principles of the
      Steps daily or we will die spiritually, emotionally and physically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      are working on practices &ndash; things we do &ndash; that we will use every
      day of our lives to move us from being restless, irritable and discontented

      hurt or threatened </em>(65: 0), or where you had expectations of others, or
      others had expectations of you &ndash; where you were <em>sore</em> or were

      from the First Column of our grudge list that our anger and resentment at <strong>who</strong>
      hurt us (or did not meet our expectations) really does hold our mind hostage
      and controls us, and blocks us from the spirit of our understanding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      learned from the Second Column that it is not who the people, institutions,
      or principles are that make us angry and resentful; it is <strong>how</strong>
      they hurt or threatened us. It is not so much who they are but how they ACT.
      Just like us, they may be good people who do foolish things. We may begin forgiving
      ourselves for our own actions and behaviors, and others for their actions, right
      here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learned from the Third Column that it is not who or even
      how they hurt us, but the way we have habitually chosen to REACT to <strong>what</strong>
      they threaten in us which determines whether we are upset or not.&nbsp; <strong>We
      react by habit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2<sup>ND</sup>&nbsp;

      must I change?&rdquo; Our present mental resentment habits lead to self pity,
      are a waste of time and, if we do not change, we may drink and die.&nbsp; Our
      own thought-habits lead us to drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we know why we must change.

      <em>motives</em> (86: 2) were the terms used by early AA&rsquo;s as mirror-images
      of the &ldquo;Four Absolutes&rdquo; of the Oxford Group: &ldquo;Absolute Selflessness,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Absolute Honesty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Absolute Purity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Absolute
      Love.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, since the Big Book authors were
      afraid of getting drunk trying for perfection, and to be absolutely too good
      too soon, they tried rather to be less selfish, less dishonest, less self-seeking,
      and less fearful. Consequently they found they were less likely to take a drink
      and less likely to live on an emotional dry bender.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite
      each Third Column instinct or role that was threatened and that you reacted
      to, write down and share precisely and in detail what your motives were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try
      to keep your written responses concise with specific examples. Avoid generalities.
      Expand upon &quot;I lied,&quot; or &quot;I was dishonest,&quot; by telling what
      happened; for example: &quot;I promised to be there and never showed up.&quot;</p>\r\n"

    - "<p><strong>Motives defined</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; What do these terms
      mean to you? (see 47: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a.)&nbsp;
      Selfishness</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Concern for self regardless of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selfishness:
      ego = me.&nbsp; Self-absorption: &quot;It&#39;s all about me!&quot; Regard for
      our own interest or happiness to the disregard of the well-being of others.
      Not aware of others and their needs. Instinctively putting our own needs first.
      A false sense of a separate self, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual selfishness: We
      could not see others&rsquo; or our real place in the universe. [Optional: <em>Our
      total inability to form a true partnership with another human being. 12&amp;12</em>,
      53: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;: We begin to see that we can change
      to our true nature &ndash; so that ultimately the best care of ourselves lies
      in our unselfish regard for the concern of the whole, that care for others includes
      us as well. Care of our selves becomes care of our soul, and is known to be
      care of all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b.) &nbsp; Dishonesty
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>A tendency to deceit, to conceal our true character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dishonest:
      Fraudulent, not what purported. The reverse of honesty; lack of probity or integrity;
      disposition to deceive, defraud, or steal; thievishness; theft, fraud. Not corresponding
      to fact. Trying to be people pleasers in order to gain approval from other people.
      Believing the lies our mind tells us, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual dishonesty:
      We lost perspective. We often did not even know we were lying because we had
      a false way of seeing reality. D-E-N-I-A-L</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;:
      We begin to see that we can change to our true nature &ndash; to be who we truly
      are, free from concealment, to be a sincere person acting in direct, frank,
      open ways. We are good and caring people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;c.) &nbsp; Self-seeking, inconsiderate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Concern
      for self over (or under) others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self-seeking: The seeking after
      our own welfare before that of others, prosecution of selfish ends. To put ourselves
      either above or below others. Seeing ourselves as better or worse than others.
      Lacking perspective, etc</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inconsiderate: Thoughtless, negligent,
      rash, incautious, heedless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual self-seeking: As a matter
      of course we tended to put our needs first, including our needs to be first,
      to be last, to be liked, to be feared, and to be pitied. [<em>Top of the heap,
      or to hide underneath it. 12&amp;12</em>, 53: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Turnaround&rsquo;:
      We begin to see that we can change from self-seeking to our true nature &ndash;
      to be thoughtful and considerate and in partnership with others and to act with
      loving compassion toward ourselves and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d.)
      &nbsp; Fear &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Dread. <em>Self-reliance failed us</em>.
      (68: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear: To feel alarmed or uneasy. The emotion of pain or
      uneasiness caused by the sense of impending danger. Apprehension of some future
      evil. [<em>Fear that we would lose something we already possessed or would fail
      to get something we wanted. 12&amp;12</em>, 76: 2], or be found out for who
      we are. To lose heart, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Habitual fear: Always anticipating
      ambush. Our apprehension of impending danger, our anxiety, was the existential
      basis for our selfishness, our dishonesty and self-seeking, and our drinking.</p>\r\n"

      everyone and everything else involved, look at each angry reaction situation
      and see what, if anything, we did to cause each event, or to make it worse,
      or to react to it and hence create more troubles for ourselves or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We

      &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>2.) &nbsp; Turnarounds</strong> &nbsp; In order to save
      our own lives, we are turning from our habitual point of view. <em>We stood
      at the turning point</em>. (59: 1)&nbsp; <em>Ideas, emotions, and attitudes
      which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast
      to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate

      our thinking so a power greater than any one of us can direct our thinking instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our

      (27: 4) that we developed in reaction to ancient <em>fancied or real</em> (66:

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE YOUR OWN!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I read Step
      4, pp. 64-71 in <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> to examine three of my blocks
      to my higher power:&nbsp; resentment, fear, and the harms done in my relationships
      / sex conduct. I list my assets too. <em>We set them on paper</em>. (64: 3)
      I begin and end writing times with meditation / prayer. With practice, this
      inventory method takes me but a moment. My reasonable best is good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;
      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<sup>ST</sup>
      &nbsp; Working of Grudge List (64: 3-65: 2)</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>WHO-HOW-WHAT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A.
      First Column: </strong><strong>WHO</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
      hurt or threatened me?&rdquo; (64: 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I list the names of
      people, places, and things that cause me to be angry, irritable, unreasonable,
      and discontented. I put them all down. At this time I do not say what they did,
      or why they bother me. I just make the list of who did it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First
      Column lesson</strong>: My head is full of resentments. There is no room for
      conscious contact with my higher power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge List &nbsp;

      with the list of names of people, places, and things that make me irritable,
      unreasonable, and discontent, I am ready to fill in the Second Column. For each
      First Column name, I state simply how they hurt me, what happened, what they
      (or I) did that makes me feel the way I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second Column
      lesson</strong>: It is less who the person is and more how his/her behavior
      made me angry. May I begin forgiveness of myself and others here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge

      part of my Self was hurt or threatened and that I reacted to?&rdquo; (64: 3,
      65: 1) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for each event in the Second Column, I write
      down in the Third Column what instincts of my Self were hurt or threatened by
      the person, place, or thing. I consider the &lsquo;three S&rsquo;s of Self&rsquo;:
      Security (material and emotional), Society/Self-esteem (fear for very existence),
      Sex (and relationship, companionship) instincts. [See <em>12&amp;12</em>, p.
      49: 0]&nbsp; Also the &lsquo;actor&rsquo;s roles&rsquo; I play. How do my own
      negative feelings and reactions, my own worn out defenses, affect me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Third
      Column lesson</strong>: I discover that what leads me to a drink is not who
      or how they hurt me, but <strong>the way I RE-ACT</strong> to what part of myself
      that was threatened. My own reactions and my own thought-habits lead me to drink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grudge

      &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) &nbsp; &nbsp; 2<sup>ND</sup> &nbsp; Working
      of Grudge List (65: 3-66: 2)</strong>: <strong>WHY</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;
      &ldquo;Why must I change?&rdquo; Resentment is a waste of time. My anger leads
      to indignation and self-pity. I will drink again if I think this way. If I drink
      I will die spiritually, mentally, and physically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<sup>RD</sup>&nbsp; Working of Grudge List (66: 3-67: 1): </strong><strong>WHEN</strong><strong>?&nbsp;
      &ldquo;</strong>When I am ready, what do I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>They, like ourselves,
      were sick too. We asked God to help us. We avoid retaliation</em>. (67: 0,1)&nbsp;
      Relaxation &nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation / prayer.&nbsp; <strong>*</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.)
      &nbsp; &nbsp; 4<sup>TH</sup>&nbsp; Working of Grudge List (67: 2)</strong>:
      <strong>WHERE</strong><strong>? &ldquo;</strong>Where am I responsible?&rdquo;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; <em>Disregard the other person involved entirely</em>. (67: 2)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      that I have completed the three column chart, I ask myself: What have I done
      to cause myself to feel this way?&nbsp; When have I done this before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      did I do in my conduct in relationship to this person, place, or thing to cause
      me to feel <em>restless, irritable and discontented</em>? (xxviii: 4) Do I have
      unreasonable expectations? Have I been acting out of fear? What am I afraid
      of? Do my own reactions lead me to be hurt and to hurt others? How old is my
      behavior?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Columns Lessons</strong>: &nbsp; What
      is my part? &nbsp; [See <em>motives</em> 86: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>selfish</strong>
      (self-absorbed)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>dishonest</strong>
      (believing my own lies, or not genuine)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where was I <strong>self-seeking</strong>
      (wanting to control or be controlled by someone else)? (67: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      was I <strong>frightened</strong> (where did self-reliance fail me)? (68 :1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where
      was I <strong>at fault</strong> (out of bounds, or missing the mark)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      could I have done instead? (69: 1,3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answers
      to these questions will help me find my character defects, shortcomings, defenses,
      and the <em>exact nature of our wrongs</em> that I will address in Step 5 (59:
      2). [<em>We learned that if we were seriously disturbed, our first need was
      to quiet that disturbance, regardless of who or what we thought caused it</em>.
      <em>12&amp;12</em>, 47: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[AND:&nbsp; I may write about how these
      old worn out defenses blocked me from growing up and growing spiritually &ndash;
      false pride, perfectionism, being phony, selfishness, impatience, self-pity,
      resentments, intolerance, alibis, dishonest thinking, putting things off, guilt
      and shame, fear, taking things for granted, etc., etc.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STEP&nbsp;
      4&nbsp; TURNAROUNDS &nbsp; </strong><strong>WILLING</strong><strong> to change&nbsp;
      &nbsp; </strong><strong>*</strong><strong>&nbsp; MEDITATION / PRAYER: &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anger</strong>:
      The one that hurt or threatened me is also a sick person. I deeply wish for
      them (and me) the same serenity and peace of mind that I would have for myself.
      God, of my understanding, save me from being hurt, threatened, insulted, or
      angry. How may I help them? (67: 0; 552: 1)&nbsp; (I say this for myself too)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fear</strong>:
      I pray that my fear be removed and my attention directed to being who you would
      have me be today. May thy will, not mine, be done. (68: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Relationship/Sex</strong>:
      <em>We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable
      situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing</em>.(70:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Willing to change</strong>: Today I may meditate, go
      to a meeting, talk with my sponsor so I am more open to my higher power and
      less restless, irritable and discontent. Today I do not have to be hurt or to
      hurt myself, and I do not have to drink.</p>\r\n"

      What did the Big Book authors say?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>READ
      &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Read about Step 5 in Chapter 6, Into Action, pp. 72 &ndash;
      75.&nbsp; Many read Step 5 in the <em>12 &amp; 12</em>. &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 5

      &nbsp; </strong>Review the work you did on Step 4. Steps 4 and 5 are action

      Book say to me about my practice of Step 5?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may read
      and discuss Chapter 6, pp. 72- 75 having to do with Step 5.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      actual taking of Step 5 is private and will not occur within the group. However,
      group members may speak generally about their experiences and share some of
      their reflective writings about taking Step 5 by the Big Book.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suggestion:
      Be specific and thorough when responding to the session questions. Try to avoid
      rote &#39;yes&#39; and &#39;no&#39; answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 72-75: 3)<strong> </strong>Cross
      off the bulleted points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) &nbsp; We are only as sick
      as our secrets.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a.)&nbsp; Fear</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step
      4 and Step 5 are the most discussed and the most skipped Steps. Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I have any fears or reservations about doing this Step? What are they?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      has working the first four Steps prepared me for taking Step 5?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was
      I so numb that I did not realize my wrongs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b.)&nbsp;
      <em>Admitted to God </em></strong>[of our own understanding]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I opened myself to the presence of a higher power before going over my inventory
      with my Fifth Step sponsor? How do I do this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is my Third
      Step decision reaffirmed by working the Fifth Step?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c.)
      &nbsp; <em>Admitted&hellip;to ourselves</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I
      <em>very much the actor</em>? (73: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had I been <em>under constant
      fear and tension</em>, and did that make <em>for more drinking</em>? (73: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>d.)
      &nbsp; <em>Admitted&hellip;to another human being</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      may happen to those who hang on <em>to some of the worst items in stock</em>,
      or have not <em>told someone else </em><em>all</em><em> their life story</em>?
      (73: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will working Step 5 help me to begin to develop new
      ways of having relationships?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I <em>in complete readiness</em>
      to <em>talk to the right person</em>, (74: 2) and to listen to their response?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;
      <em>The exact nature of our wrongs</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I &hellip;<em>get
      down to causes and conditions</em>? (64: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I inventoried
      <em>my grosser handicaps</em>? (71: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does <em>the exact
      nature of our defects</em> mean? (72: 1)&nbsp; What is behind my alcoholism
      and the reasons I acted out in the ways I did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do I need to
      admit the exact nature &ndash; my own basic starting point <strong>/ </strong>motive
      &ndash; of my wrongs and not simply the wrongs themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is the distinction between my <em>motives</em> (86: 2) and my actions or behaviors?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      5th Step promises: Do I now feel I <em>can look the world in the eye</em>? (75:
      2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE
      OF STEP 5 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice being honest
      with myself, accepting who I am, both the good and the harm that I do, and living
      up to my potential?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where am I responsible and where am I not
      responsible? What patterns would I rather not repeat in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I practice the courage to share the parts of myself that should <em>never
      see the light of day</em>? (73: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice being committed
      to trusting this process, trusting another person, and trusting myself to do
      it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice relying on my higher power, relying on
      the program of recovery and relying on the fellowship?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      every twist of character, every dark cranny of the past</em>. (75: 1, 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      we have admitted to God of our understanding, to ourselves, and to another human
      being the exact nature of our wrongs, then according to the Big Book and under
      the conditions of this day, we have taken Step 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;An optional written Step 5 inventory is on p. 91 of this workbook. The
      actual taking of this Step will occur outside the group. The group may decide
      to observe taking Step 5 in a manner similar to the way some AA groups celebrate
      anniversaries.<strong>STEP&nbsp; 5 &nbsp; WRITTEN&nbsp; INVENTORY&nbsp; </strong>[optional]<strong>&nbsp;

      Defects</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways are my defects really basic
      human traits that have been distorted by my own self-centeredness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      what specific ways am I addicted to outside things to change my feelings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I list each defect I have and the ways I act on it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      do I feel when I act out on each defect? What feelings do my defects help me
      change or avoid? Is every defect another face of fear?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would
      my life be like without each defect?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      of my unwanted defects am I dismayed to find are still here?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which
      of my defects have I had most of my life, and are like survival skills? How
      did each defect (or pattern or defense or role or mask) protect me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which
      unhealthy behaviors do I seem to repeat over and over?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I fear
      I cannot change? Does my personality seem to equal my defects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      have I changed so far? What defects do I no longer have to act on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I see the principles of 12 Step recovery as being the opposite of my character
      defects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I <em>entirely ready</em> (59: 2) to let my higher
      power set my character defects at one remove from me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      &nbsp; Letting Go</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When will the pain of holding on to
      my defects of character become greater than my fear of change? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      many of my thought-habits brought nothing but pain and degradation to my life?&nbsp;
      Do I need help in dealing with them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I let go through
      prayer and meditation and reflect on my higher power?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my surrender deepen in this step? Can I relax since I do not do it alone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      action can I take that shows that I am entirely ready?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III

      has &ldquo;my way&rdquo; landed me in difficulty?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I acting
      as my own higher power?&nbsp; [See <em>quit playing God</em>, BB, 62: 3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my usefulness to myself and others depend on my being balanced?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      does my gratitude for my life in recovery relate to my staying right size?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I take a new perspective on the world and so act differently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I grow to have &ldquo;solution-based&rdquo; thinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      is <em>humility</em> (55: 4) related to <em>honesty</em> (58: 1) and <em>sanity</em>
      (5: 5; 37: 1) in regards to my own sense of proportion and perspective?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AA
      literature focuses on humility as seeing things in true perspective, as they
      really are. [Optional, see also <em>12&amp;12</em> pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humility
      is a sense of our own humanness. We are truly just trying our best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      by sharing their experience, strength, and hope in this matter of prayer and
      meditation?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is the Serenity Prayer (<em>12&amp;12</em>,

      my higher power do Steps 6 and 7 for me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)&nbsp;
      <em>Remove our shortcomings</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Practice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why
      are <em>defects of character</em> in Step 6 called <em>shortcomings</em> in
      Step 7? (59: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is my <em>self-centered fear</em> the <em>chief
      activator</em> of my character defects? [<em>12&amp;12</em> 76: 2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I see the many faces of my fear (my defects) and not deny or overlook them?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I recognize my fear and/or anger, bring it to awareness, and deal with it
      in a healthy manner?&nbsp; Can I ask for help to change my fears?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      can I stop building walls, and act instead as if I want to be happy, serene
      and sane?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I prepared to take an active role in the new and
      healthier world that I am now a part of?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I ask for the strength
      to do the practice?&nbsp; What does the term &lsquo;practice&rsquo; mean to
      me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE
      OF STEP 7 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has my sense of perspective been
      out of proportion lately?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I accept my powerlessness
      over my shortcomings as well as my alcoholism?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I humbly
      ask for strength, practice spiritual principles, and get out of my higher power&rsquo;s
      way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I become more conscious of my motives and intentions
      before I act?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of fear and anger, can I respond with love
      and patience?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I practice trust and being worthy, by practicing
      being responsible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, can I do what the alcoholic in me says,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have there been times
      when I have been able to refrain from acting on a character defect and to practice
      a spiritual principle instead? Do I recognize this as the higher power of my

      &nbsp; &nbsp; WITH THE GROUP: &nbsp; &nbsp; PRACTICE &ndash;&nbsp; What does
      the Big Book say to me about my practice of Step 8?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      read selections from Into Action pp. 76-84 together. We share our writings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without
      mentioning names, we talk about those we included on our list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does
      my list have too many, or too few, people on it?&nbsp; Have I included everyone
      I have ever interacted with? Did I only include people I committed egregious
      acts against?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points of Focus and
      Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 76: 3-77: 1; 78: 2-79: 0; 80: 5; 83: 2,
      3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.)&nbsp; <em>All persons we had harmed</em>&ndash;
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where had I been at fault?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may
      I be clear to myself about my responsibility in the wrongs I have done? [Responsible:
      Able to respond, soberly and appropriately. Accountable. Reliable.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I accept my responsibility to other people, yet not accept responsibility
      for other people?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I let go of the feeling of responsibility
      for the way certain people treated me?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I owe amends to
      people who have also harmed me? (77: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I put my own name
      on the top of my list of people I have harmed? Why or why not? [see <em>12&amp;12</em>,
      79: 3-80: 0, 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) What harms have
      I committed against the people on my list?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>Business
      acquaintances</em></strong>:&nbsp; (76: 4) Did I not cooperate with others or
      not put in a day&rsquo;s work?&nbsp; Did I pad expense accounts or steal money?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>Friends
      we have hurt</em></strong>. (76: 4) Have I gossiped or been emotionally unavailable?
      Have I stolen from them? Have I failed to keep in contact?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-Those
      <em>we hate</em>.</strong> (77: 1) Have I wished ill-will upon them? Have I
      spoken badly of them? Have I committed the harms described above?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-Our
      creditors</strong>: We <em>owe money</em>. (78: 2)&nbsp; Have I failed to admit
      that money or services are owed? Have I failed to make arrangements to pay what
      is owed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>-Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense</em></strong>.
      (78: 3) Have I paid my fine and done my time?&nbsp; Have I made a commitment
      not to repeat those crimes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>-<em>We have domestic troubles</em>.</strong>
      (80: 5) <em>The family</em>, (83: 1) spouse, or <em>parents</em>. (82: 2) Have
      I physically / emotionally / verbally abused my spouse, children, or other family
      members? Have I been emotionally unavailable to those family members?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>-Some
      people cannot be seen.</em></strong> (82: 3)&nbsp; Have I done any or all of
      the above to those I cannot locate or who have died?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.)
      <em>Willing to make amends to them all</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What have
      I done to become willing to make these amends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why am I not willing
      to make amends with some of the people on my list? Do I have fear of making
      direct amends? Do I have persistent resentment toward some? Am I unable to see
      the harm I have caused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making amends, am I still trying to
      please, or control, or punish, or behave in some other way that interferes with
      an honest relationship? Will it help to revisit Steps 4 and 5, and Steps 6 and
      7 about these issues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would my life be like if I had already
      made these amends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III &nbsp; &nbsp;
      DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 8 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I move beyond
      my resentments, and blaming others, and believing I was the innocent victim,
      and all my other justifications for the harms I caused?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are there
      any names I have not added to my list? Am I willing to add them now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am
      I beginning to feel compassion and empathy for others, including myself? Describe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I have peace with my past, so that I may have peace in the present and future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*

      pages 76-84 in Chapter 6, Into Action on Step 9. ~Support is needed to carry

      1; 83: 1-84: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) Ask for willingness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      is making amends a commitment to a continuous process of change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why
      is making amends more than just saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      about financial amends? What behaviors do I need to amend?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I owe amends to people who have also harmed me?&nbsp; (77: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I owe amends to anyone who is dead? What was special about that person that
      I might be able to use in planning my amends?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I genuine
      in making my amends, or do I have hidden motives, such as to gain acceptance
      or love from someone else, or to prove them wrong and me right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can
      I let go of the outcome, knowing that I have no control over the other person&rsquo;s
      response?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.) <em>Direct amends</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The

      DAILY MEDITATION / PRAYER &nbsp; </strong>Meditation and prayer, like other

      &nbsp; &nbsp; WITH THE GROUP: &nbsp; &nbsp; PRACTICE &ndash; &nbsp; What does
      the Big Book say to me about my practice of Step 11?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      review the three meditation / prayer practices of Step 11, BB pp. 85 - 88.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Points
      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Consider 85: 3-88: 3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.)
      <em>Prayer and meditation</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 11 begins with
      the word <em>sought </em>(59: 2), the past tense of &ldquo;to seek&rdquo;; how
      and what am I seeking?&nbsp; Do I have a specific spiritual path? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is my understanding of the differences between religion and spirituality? What
      have I done to explore my own spirituality?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I recognize that
      a moment of silence is meditation, where I may quiet my mind on a regular basis
      so that I can gain understanding and knowledge from my higher power &ndash;
      my own <em>unsuspected inner resource</em>? (567: 4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heard
      in a meeting: &ldquo;Prayer is talking to.&nbsp; Meditation is listening for.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Optional:
      &lsquo;<em>Thy will not mine, be done.&rsquo; &hellip; Just saying it over and
      over will often enable us to clear a channel choked up with anger, fear, frustration,
      or misunderstanding, and permit us to return to the surest help of all &ndash;
      our search for God </em>[of our understanding]<em>&rsquo;s will, not our own,
      in the moment of stress</em>. <em>12&amp;12</em>, 103: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)&nbsp;<em>
      Conscious contact</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Big Book authors speak of
      the <strong><em>Retire at night</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (86:1): &hellip;<em>Review
      our day. Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest, or afraid</em>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Were
      we thinking of ourselves most of the time? &hellip; After making our review
      we ask God </em>[of our understanding]<em>&rsquo;s forgiveness and inquire,
      what corrective measures should be taken</em>? (86: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      also is the <strong><em>On awakening</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (86:
      2, 3 - 87: 0, 1, 2):&nbsp; <em>We ask God </em>[of our understanding]<em> to
      direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest
      or self-seeking </em><strong><em>motives</em></strong>. (86: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We
      ask for freedom from self-will</em>&hellip;. (87: 1)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Be
      quick to see where religious people are right</em>. (87: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And,
      there is the <strong><em>Through the day</em> meditation / prayer</strong> (87:
      3 - 88: 0): &hellip;<em>We </em><strong><em>pause</em></strong><em>, when agitated
      or doubtful, and </em><strong><em>ask</em></strong><em> for the right thought
      or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show,
      humbly saying to ourselves many times each day &lsquo;Thy will be done.</em>&rsquo;
      (87: 3 - 88: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.) <em>The power
      to carry that out</em>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do we pray only for <em>knowledge</em>
      of God&#39;s will for us and <em>the power to carry that out</em>? (59: 2)&nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does humility apply to this?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III
      &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 11 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I clear away my insistence that I want or I need something, and let things
      be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I remember that I am not in charge of the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I have the faith and courage to seek the knowledge, the will and the power
      to live my life in a way that brings serenity and peace of mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I pass on to others my inner knowing of creation&rsquo;s deep wish of well
      being for me and others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I make a commitment to the practice
      of regular meditation and prayer?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have I meditated and prayed

      in the loving energy of that wish for you to have deepest well-being, happiness

      of Focus and Reflection &nbsp; </strong>(Read BB Chapter 7. See pp. 109-110
      this workbook.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.) <em>Spiritual awakening as </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em>

      result of working the Steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By doing my own work in Steps 1 through
      11, have I developed a new way of thinking, feeling and acting, and connecting
      with others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it my experience that I have undergone <em>a profound
      alteration</em> <em>in</em> [my] <em>reaction</em><em> to life</em>? (567: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I had a <em>personality change sufficient to bring about recovery</em>? (567:
      1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What lasting changes have resulted from my spiritual awakening?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having
      awakened to the reality that I too am a good and caring person, can I invite

      my experience, does this message include that there is hope, we are not alone,
      we can stay sober, and we can recover?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did someone carry
      the message to me?&nbsp; (See p. 18: 4,5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why was an AA member

      are the step-by-step requirements for Twelfth Step work? (See BB Chapter 7,
      and this SbBB workbook pp. 109 - 110)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May I share who I am, where

      (60: 0) Does it mean &lsquo;to keep trying&rsquo;?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      does it mean to practice <em>these principles</em> (60: 0) in all my affairs?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do
      I find life offering opportunities to repeatedly experience my old shortcomings,
      my old patterns, my old behaviors, my old actor&rsquo;s roles (60: 4), my old
      thought-habits and my old motives (86: 2), but each time with new understanding?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III
      &nbsp; &nbsp; DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 12 PRINCIPLES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I deeply wish that others, including myself, may be happy, joyous, and free?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      may I understand that sometimes the best way of loving and helping is to stop
      enabling someone else to drink?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my attitude about sponsorship?
      What is my attitude about service?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How may I practice spiritual
      principles, such as compassion, regardless of how I feel?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      my disease is often expressed as self-centeredness, how may I express my recovery
      as selfless service?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

      STEP 12&nbsp; ON A DAILY BASIS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We take Step 12 in the
      first paragraph on BB page 89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group reading
      of the last portion of Chapter 11, A Vision for You, is a fitting way to end
      these Steps by the Big Book group sessions. (164: 2, 3, 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Heard
      in a meeting:&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want to be happy, serve others.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How
      may we alcoholics live<em> </em><strong><em>happy</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>joyous</em></strong><em>,
      and </em><strong><em>free</em></strong><em>?</em> (133: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>Happiness</strong>
      is being free of suffering &ndash; free of our mind&#39;s tortured reactions
      to the things that may hurt or frighten us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>Joy</strong>
      is taking grateful delight in another&#39;s happiness, including our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>Freedom</strong>
      is the reprieve from grasping onto our self-centered alcoholism/addiction, our
      self-absorption, just for today.&quot;]</p>\r\n"
