      write about:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your own definition of each word in this Step,
      and every Step. Then look up each word individually in the dictionary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Write
      what each part means to you: We&nbsp;<strong>admit</strong>&nbsp;that we are&nbsp;<strong>powerless</strong>&nbsp;over
      our&nbsp;<strong>alcoholism-addiction</strong>&nbsp;and that our lives [and

      the Big Book and&nbsp;<em>12&amp;12</em>suggestions for meditation and prayer,
      or choose a practice that is in line with your own belief system. The goal is
      to set aside some quiet reflection time, perhaps 15-20 minutes twice a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>II
      &nbsp; &nbsp; WITH THE GROUP:&nbsp; PRACTICE &ndash; What does the Big Book
      say to me about my practice of Step 1?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we each go
      about our daily activities, we think about the people, places, and things that
      are unmanageable, or over which we are powerless. Each day we write: &ldquo;I
      cannot control / have no power over________.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also
      list what we can control and what we do have power over.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We

      by Dr. Silkworth in the Doctor&rsquo;s Opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;

      (59: 2)]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How am I affected by Dr. Silkworth&rsquo;s definition
      of alcoholism as a medical problem? (xxx: 0) [Disease: (L- To lack ease.) Involuntary
      disability. See 64: 3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I drink&nbsp;<em>essentially because&nbsp;</em>[I]<em>&nbsp;like

      been&nbsp;<em>restless, irritable, and discontented</em>? (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have
      I sought&nbsp;<em>the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking
      a few drinks</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describe in detail how I succumbed&nbsp;<em>to
      the desire again</em>? (xxix: 0)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what ways did I reach
      the point where I could not differentiate&nbsp;<em>the true from the false</em>?&nbsp;
      (xxviii: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did I first experience an abnormal mental obsession
      with alcohol? Describe. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      sick as my alcoholic mind? (xxvi: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is my understanding
      of the concept of alcoholism as the&nbsp;<em>manifestation of an allergy</em>?
      (xxviii: 1)&nbsp; [Allergy (Gr allos &ndash; strange): An abnormal reaction.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
      do I feel about the idea of hospitalization? (xxvi: 4; xxviii: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When

      and over</em>? (xxix: 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are my reflections on the ideas
      that alcoholism&nbsp;<em>has never been&hellip;permanently eradicated</em>;
      and that&nbsp;<em>the only relief&hellip;is entire abstinence</em>? (xxx: 5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When

      change</em>? (xxix: 1, 3)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is meant by being&nbsp;<em>required
      to follow a few simple rules</em>? (xxix: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that,
      if I have been abstinent from alcohol a while, Step 1 is about my powerlessness
      over some other behavior or thought-habit that reflects the unmanageability
      of my life and mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I aware that I need to find a way to stop
      that behavior so that my surrender is not blocked by continued acting out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      is of significance to me in this chapter?&nbsp; What do I not agree with?</p>\r\n"

      problem, the solution, and the program of action to recover from alcoholism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.
      The&nbsp;<strong>Problem</strong>: From Dr. Silkworth, Bill learned of the medical
      problem of alcoholism as both a mental and a physical illness. (7:1; xxv-xxxii)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.
      The&nbsp;<strong>Solution</strong>: From Dr. Carl Jung, (through Roland H. and
      Ebby T.) Bill learned of the spiritual solution to the problem as a&nbsp;<em>necessary
      vital spiritual experience</em>. (27: 5; see also 9: 6; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.
      The&nbsp;<strong>Program of Action</strong>: From the Oxford Group (through
      Ebby T.), Bill learned of the discipline of practicing a step by step program
      of principles and action that opens one to the necessary&nbsp;<em>vital spiritual
      experiences.</em>&nbsp; (27: 4) [See also He Sold Himself Short, 263: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WRITE

      unmanageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>TALK &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Speak

      review selections from Bill&#39;s Story together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We each
      consider sharing our own writings and personal Step 1 stories with the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather

      does an&nbsp;<em>appalling lack of perspective&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;relate to sanity,
      honesty, or humility? (5: 5)&nbsp; What do sanity, honesty, and humility mean

      could not take so much as one drink</em>? (5: 4) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did such&nbsp;<em>self-knowledge</em>&nbsp;(7:

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is how the Big Book authors

      The&nbsp;<strong>Problem</strong>: From Dr. Silkworth, Bill learned of the medical

      The&nbsp;<strong>Solution</strong>: From Dr. Carl Jung, (through Roland H. and

      vital spiritual experience</em>. (27: 5; see also 9: 6; 567-8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.
      The&nbsp;<strong>Program of Action</strong>: From the Oxford Group (through
      Ebby T.), Bill learned of the discipline of practicing a step by step program
      of principles and action that opens one to the necessary&nbsp;<em>vital spiritual

      the weapon&hellip;that one day would turn&hellip;like a boomerang and&hellip;cut
      me to ribbons</em>? (2: 2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was there a time for me when&nbsp;<em>liquor

      honesty, or humility? (5: 5)&nbsp; What do sanity, honesty, and humility mean

      are my reflections on Dr. Silkworth&#39;s proposition that we have been&nbsp;<em>seriously
      ill, bodily and mentally</em>? (7: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I see that&nbsp;<em>I
      could not take so much as one drink</em>? (5: 4) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did such&nbsp;<em>self-knowledge</em>&nbsp;(7:
      2) of the problem of&nbsp;<em>the insanity of that first drink&nbsp;</em>(8:
      2) alone keep me sober?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill describes taking Step 1 by

      ways has alcohol been my master? (8: 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.)

      takes Step 2 when he understands that,&nbsp;<em>nothing more was required...to

      (12: 4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that Bill was instructed&nbsp;<em>to sit quietly</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>test&nbsp;</em>[his]<em>&nbsp;thinking
